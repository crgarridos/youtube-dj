00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:02,076
Hi. I'm David Hill with New York Habitat.

2
00:00:02,076 --> 00:00:05,231
Welcome to another New York Habitat video tour of London.

3
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:08,791
Today we will be exploring Canary Wharf and Docklands.

4
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:31,607
Canary Wharf is one of the two main financial centres in London

5
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,206
alongside the City of London.

6
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,891
Nearly 100,000 people work in Canary Wharf

7
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:38,622
and it is home to some of the UK's tallest buildings,

8
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:43,376
housing some of the world's major financial and media organisations.

9
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:14,079
Canary Wharf and the Docklands area are in the east of London

10
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,996
focussing on the Isle of Dogs.

11
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:19,588
North of the River Thames this runs from Limehouse in the East

12
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:22,826
to London City Airport in the West.

13
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:29,814
Cabot Square, named after the Italian explorer

14
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:32,779
is one of the central squares in the heart of Canary Wharf

15
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:35,500
next to the Canary Wharf DLR station.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,172
Home to several renowned investment and retail banks

17
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:41,550
it is a thriving metropolis with several restaurants

18
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,326
and a large shopping centre.

19
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:25,639
West India Quay is a stone's throw from Cabot Square.

20
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,559
Since its heyday as a major quay involved in shipping goods

21
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:32,699
such as tea, sugar, and rum, it has undergone major development.

22
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,826
With the London Docks no longer in operation

23
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:39,310
West India Quay has retained some of its historic charm on the outside

24
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,342
but now provides residential housing, hotels,

25
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,623
and restaurants for the Canary Wharf locals.

26
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,784
Telling the story of the river Thames,

27
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,226
the Museum of London Docklands is a fascinating historical journey

28
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:09,080
starting with the Roman settlement in AD43

29
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,039
through to the modern day development

30
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,459
with some wonderful galleries.

31
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,799
New York Habitat has a number of apartment opportunities

32
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,221
in the Canary Wharf and Docklands area.

33
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:38,110
Renowned for its modern wharf-side developments

34
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,377
why not check out nyhabitat.com

35
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:43,433
to find some of these hidden gems.

36
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:51,176
At the south end of the Isle of Dogs,

37
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:54,495
Island Gardens has some fantastic views across the river.

38
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,486
Looking across, you will catch views of Greenwich Hospital,

39
00:03:57,486 --> 00:04:01,244
National Maritime Museum, and the Cutty Sark.

40
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,179
Did you know you could walk under the river Thames?!

41
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:23,960
This tunnel beneath the river has been open since 1902!

42
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:27,789
Built to replace an unreliable ferry service,

43
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,422
this 370 metre tunnel will take you from Island Gardens

44
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:32,570
to the south side of the river

45
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,806
near to the Cutty Sark in Greenwich.

46
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:48,157
In the 18th century

47
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,855
the River Thames was drained and development started.

48
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,982
As a tidal river it was at risk of flooding

49
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:59,132
but the Thames Barrier, completed in 1984, now protects the city.

50
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,923
London's most central airport is right here in Docklands.

51
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:20,385
Opened in 1988 it has become a trans-Atlantic hub

52
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:23,853
seeing more than 3 million passengers per year.

53
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,719
There are a number of ways of travelling to and from

54
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,267
Canary Wharf and Docklands.

55
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:38,469
There is the Thames Clipper water-bus service.

56
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,736
The Jubilee line of the London underground.

57
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:45,997
And the popular and fully automated Docklands Light Railway (or DLR).

58
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:01,827
This is Canary Wharf.

59
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:04,922
With over 240 shops, bars, and restaurants,

60
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,627
this area has plenty to offer.

61
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:11,175
A key business location or a quiet place to sit and relax,

62
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:13,952
there is plenty to see and do.

63
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,966
Well, we've come to the end of our video tour
